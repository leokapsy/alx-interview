Pascal's triangle is a triangular array of numbers in which the first and last numbers in each row are 1, and each of the other numbers is the sum of the two numbers immediately above it in the previous row. The triangle is named after the French mathematician Blaise Pascal, although it was known to Chinese mathematicians over 500 years earlier. The triangle has many interesting properties and patterns, and is used in various areas of mathematics, including combinatorics, probability theory, and number theory. It is also used in computer science for tasks such as generating fractals and testing software
